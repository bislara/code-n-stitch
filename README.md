- Create your own Issues!
- Wait for the admin's approval comment on the issue 
- Fork the Repository and create a Branch for any Issue by following the branch creation rule.
- Create a Pull Request (from your branch to the main repository master branch) which will be promptly reviewed and suggestions would be added to improve it.
- Add Screenshots to help us know what this issue is all about.

## 💻 PROJECT SETUP (FOR DEVELOPMENT)
* After forking the main repository, Clone the repository from your github account using `git clone https://github.com/-username-/code-n-stitch`
* Run `git fetch`
* Checkout to your specific branch using `git checkout -b YOUR_BRANCH_NAME`
* Start development

---

## 📫 BRANCH CREATION RULE
* Go to [this](https://github.com/bislara/code-n-stitch/issues) link and see the issues created by you or assigned to you.
* Create a new branch for each issue in your forked repository.
* The name of your branch should follow the following rule: **[ISSUE #]-[TITLE (all lowercase letters and words separated by a hyphen(-))]**.
* That is, if the *TITLE* of the issue **#8** is **Dashboard - Development**, then the branch name should be **8-dashboard-development**
* Perform all the development activities in this branch and raise PRs accordingly with proper commit message and description along with screenshots, images (if necessary)

---
## 📫 RULES FOR PULL REQUEST (PR) RAISE
* Use proper commit message describing the tasks performed in the commit.
* Treat `master` branch as your master branch, i.e. all your PRs should use `master` as the target branch. e.g. `git push origin YOUR_BRANCH_NAME` and then use `master` as the target branch while creating PRs.
