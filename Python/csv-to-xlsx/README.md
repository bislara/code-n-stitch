This Python script converts CSV (.csv) files to Excel (.xlsx) file.

The only requirement for this file to work is the `pandas` library.

It can be installed using the command:
`pip install pandas`

<b>Note:</b><br>
If the concerned CSV file is in the same directory as that of this pyscript, its filename would work as the input. If it is located in some other directory, its filename full absolute path would be needed to be given in the input.
